so [align] while [align] turning [align] in [align] my [align] and [align] [sep] again [align] i [align] cannot [align] sleep [align] [sep] walk [align] out [align] the [align] door [align] and [align] up [align] the [align] street [align] [sep] look [align] at [align] the [align] stars [align] beneath [align] my [align] feet [align] [sep] remember [align] that [align] i [align] did [align] wrong [align] [sep] so [align] here [align] i [align] go [align] [sep] hello [align] [sep] there [align] is [align] no [align] place [align] i [align] cannot [align] go [align] [sep] my [align] mind [align] is [align] muddy [align] but [align] [sep] my [align] heart [align] is [align] heavy [align] does [align] it [align] show [align] [sep] i [align] lose [align] the [align] track [align] that [align] loses [align] me [align] [sep] so [align] here [align] i [align] go [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] and [align] so [align] i [align] sent [align] some [align] men [align] to [align] fight [align] [sep] and [align] one [align] came [align] back [align] at [align] dead [align] of [align] night [align] [sep] said [align] have [align] you [align] seen [align] my [align] enemy [align] [sep] said [align] he [align] looked [align] just [align] like [align] me [align] [sep] so [align] i [align] set [align] out [align] to [align] cut [align] myself [align] [sep] and [align] here [align] i [align] go [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] uh [align] [sep] not [align] calling [align] for [align] a [align] second [align] chance [align] [sep] screaming [align] at [align] the [align] top [align] of [align] my [align] voice [align] [sep] give [align] me [align] reason [align] [sep] but [align] give [align] me [align] choice [align] [sep] cos [align] just [align] [sep]
the [align] the [align] same [align] mistake [align] the [align] [sep] uh [align] uh [align] [sep]
when [align] one [align] becomes [align] two [align] [sep] can [align] two [align] become [align] [sep] when [align] one [align] becomes [align] two [align] [sep] can [align] two [align] become [align] [sep] one [align] will [align] be [align] running [align] one [align] [sep] will [align] be [align] one [align] will [align] be [align] fighting [align] one [align] will [align] be [align] born [align] [sep] one [align] will [align] be [align] lived [align] through [align] [sep] one [align] will [align] be [align] turned [align] where [align] will [align] we [align] be [align] one [align] will [align] be [align] will [align] will [align] be [align] will [align] be [align] one [align] will [align] be [align] turned [align] where [align] will [align] we [align] one [align] one [align] be [align] one [align] be [align] will [align] be [align] will [align] to [align] [sep] will [align] be [align] will [align] be [align] will [align] where [align] will [align] we [align] be [align] [sep] hold [align] me [align] close [align] in [align] the [align] setting [align] sun [align] [sep] when [align] one [align] becomes [align] two [align] [sep]
he [align] for [align] [sep] in [align] out [align] [sep] with [align] the [align] soft [align] [sep] he [align] jumped [align] so [align] jumped [align] high [align] [sep] then [align] he [align] touched [align] i [align] met [align] him [align] a [align] [sep] in [align] i [align] so [align] and [align] [sep] he [align] [sep] as [align] spoke [align] out [align] [sep] he [align] talked [align] of [align] life [align] [sep] he [align] talked [align] of [align] [sep] he [align] clicked [align] [sep] mister [align] mister [align] [sep]
