and [align] now [align] the [align] [sep] final [align] my [align] friend [align] say [align] it [align] state [align] [sep] my [align] case [align] of [align] which [align] lived [align] a [align] life [align] [sep] full [align] [sep] i [align] have [align] travelled [align] each [align] and [align] every [align] highway [align] [sep] and [align] more [align] much [align] more [align] than [align] this [align] [sep] i [align] did [align] my [align] way [align] [sep] regrets [align] had [align] a [align] few [align] [sep] but [align] then [align] again [align] too [align] few [align] to [align] mention [align] [sep] i [align] did [align] what [align] i [align] had [align] to [align] and [align] saw [align] it [align] i [align] [sep] each [align] course [align] [sep] each [align] careful [align] along [align] the [align] by [align] way [align] [sep] and [align] more [align] much [align] more [align] than [align] i [align] did [align] it [align] my [align] way [align] [sep] yes [align] there [align] were [align] times [align] sure [align] you [align] knew [align] [sep] when [align] i [align] bit [align] off [align] more [align] than [align] i [align] could [align] chew [align] [sep] but [align] through [align] it [align] i [align] stood [align] tall [align] [sep] and [align] did [align] it [align] my [align] way [align] [sep] loved [align] laughed [align] and [align] cried [align] [sep] i [align] did [align] it [align] my [align] way [align] [sep] i [align] had [align] my [align] fill [align] [sep] had [align] my [align] fill [align] my [align] share [align] of [align] losing [align] [sep] and [align] now [align] as [align] tears [align] subside [align] [sep] i [align] find [align] it [align] so [align] amusing [align] [sep]
to [align] think [align] i [align] did [align] that [align] [sep] and [align] may [align] i [align] say [align] not [align] in [align] a [align] shy [align] way [align] [sep] oh [align] no [align] oh [align] no [align] not [align] me [align] [sep] i [align] did [align] my [align] way [align] [sep] for [align] what [align] is [align] man [align] what [align] has [align] he [align] got [align] [sep] if [align] not [align] [sep] not [align] to [align] say [align] the [align] truly [align] and [align] not [align] words [align] of [align] [sep]
i [align] meet [align] face [align] [sep]
